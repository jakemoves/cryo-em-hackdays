## To do
- [x] selection
- [x] inspection
- [x] keyboard nav
- [ ] reject particle - probably means switching to checkboxes or fully custom (if we want a third "approved" state)
- [x] break out components
- [x] particle components?
- [x] generate fun decent data & render it
- [x] plot a few things on canvas
- [x] basic datavis with observable 
- [x] practice a reducer
- [x] svelte stores
- [x] performance: locate slow function, convert to async, add skeleton
- [x] review types vs classes

### Cut line

- [ ] typescript optionals cleanup - if context call fails, how to catch?
- [ ] component events
- [ ] ORM and queries
- [ ] tests
- [ ] workers
- [ ] ws refresh - binary blobs?

## Issues
### Day 1
- refresh doesn't reset inspectedParticle
- tabbing onto first radio doesn't select it therefore up and down arrows won't work. right arrow or space focuses the first element and then up/down arrows will work

- noise is super slow
